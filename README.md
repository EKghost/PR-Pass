<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a simple password generating solution so that you never have to remember complex passwords. Based on the inputs given by the user, A word and a Number, this tool generates passwords on-the-go which you can copy to the clipboard easily. The tool does not require any external connectivity and is pretty lightweight to use.
